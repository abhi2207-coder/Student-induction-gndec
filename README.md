### Day 1

We began college life with a visit to the Gurudwara. The atmosphere there was peaceful and positive. We had some really deep and inspirational thoughts, which started the day off to a great start. Then we were served breakfast, which was tasty and tastefully arranged.
I'm telling you, when we saw the Gurdwara, I genuinely liked it. The environment there was serene and peaceful. The building appeared stunning, and the whole atmosphere provided a very positive impression. It was a pleasant beginning to the day.

We then moved on to the college auditorium, where the rest of the event was hosted. We were greeted by the Principal of the college in his warm address. He provided some valuable insights about discipline, concentration, and making the most of college life. He told us to always be curious, an active listener, and never hesitate asking any questions. His address was truly inspirational and motivated us even more to be a part of the college.Next, we proceeded for the speeches in the auditorium, and then visited our respective departments. The labs, classrooms, and the surroundings seemed very good. All of it seemed new and thrilling, and I really liked the department a lot.College's first day was really a memorable day. From going to the Gurdwara in the morning to listening to the speeches in the auditorium and checking out our departments, all of it seemed thrilling and new. The atmosphere, the individuals, and the aura around gave me a sense of happiness and a little more confidence regarding this new adventure. Honestly, I did not expect the day to turn out so well, but it really made a positive impact on me.

### Day 2

On the second day of the induction programme, we wrote our proficiency tests for both Maths and English. We wrote these tests to test our basic knowledge in the subject and enable the faculty to understand where we are currently. The mood was a little tense that day since everyone was a bit apprehensive about how the tests would fare.

The Maths test contained a combination of fundamentals and reasoning questions. A few of them were simple, while a couple of questions required us to think a little harder. The English test was heavily focused on grammar, reading comprehension, and vocabulary. It was not very difficult, but we needed to concentrate.

Honestly, the highlight was that the tests did not feel like pressure. They were more like a reflection on what we already know and where we can do better. In general, Day 2 was more scholarly than the first day, but still felt like part of settling into college life.

### Day 3

The third day of the induction program was all about learning and experiencing new things. We had two lectures in our schedule, both of which took place in the college auditorium. The first was by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, who delivered a highly informative speech on IAPT (Indian Association of Physics Teachers). He told us what IAPT is, how it fosters the development of physics education in India, and how students can be a part of it through various activities and exams. He also talked about his own experiences and encouraged us to go beyond textbooks and learn the subject more extensively. It was a very awakening session for most of us.

Then we had the second lecture of Dr. Priya Darshni Madam, where she discussed Universal Human Values. Her session was more emotional and reflective. She discussed the need to be kind, respectful, empathetic, and lead a meaningful life. The manner in which she described how values relate to everyday life made it extremely relatable. She urged us to look inside ourselves and reflect on our behavior towards others, rather than only being concerned about academics.

Both lectures were very different in content — one academic and one life and character-oriented — but combined, they made the day truly significant. It was as though we didn't just go for lectures, but learned something worthwhile for life.
### Day 4

The fourth day of the induction programme was different, as we were attending our actual college classes for the first time. All the sessions so far were either introductory or seminar-based, but Day 4 provided the real feel of being engineering students. The first class of the day was P2P (Peer to Peer Learning), which was led by our seniors. They began by introducing us to the basics of C++ programming. They taught us how to construct a simple "Hello World" program, and each step was explained in a highly understandable manner. We were all new to coding, but the friendly attitude of the seniors made us at ease. They asked us to raise doubts and learn at our own comfort. It was wonderful to grasp something useful from the very start.

Then we had our second class — BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering) — through which we were introduced to the topic by Professor Harminder Kaur. She greeted us warmly and engaged with all of us to make the session interesting. Rather than dashing straight into the syllabus, she took the time to understand us, inquired about our interests, and told us how this subject would prove useful in the subsequent semesters. Her mode of explanation was simple and inspiring, which made a great impression on all of us.

Following these two sessions, we had a brief break, which provided an opportunity to relax and socialize with our fellow classmates. It was welcome relief halfway through a full day.

After the break, we had a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV). The class was about learning life outside academics — values such as respect, kindness, empathy, and self-awareness. The manner in which the concepts were explained made us introspect about our behavior and attitude. It was a serene and insightful class.

The last session of the day was taken by the Causmic Club. The club members presented themselves and told us about what they do in the club. They explained their experiences, activities, and the possibilities we could have by being a member of it. It was thrilling to see how college life is not all about academics, but also about clubs, events, and discovering our interests.

Day 4, in total, was long but packed with learning, interactions, and new experiences. It seemed like we were actually integrating into the college.

### Day 5
It was on the fifth day that our section was summoned to finalize the ID card registration. The task was swift and easy. Before we knew it, our day was over.

### Day 6

The sixth day of our induction programme began with a Chemistry lecture led by Mr. Karan Bhalla. As he entered the lecture room, he welcomed all of us with a big smile, which made the environment receptive and friendly. The session began with him asking each one of us to introduce ourselves, which made it easy for him to connect with the class. His manner of speech was also extremely polite and respectful, and he ensured that everyone was comfortable throughout the interaction. Once the introductions had been completed, he proceeded to teach us a few critical Chemistry formulas. Although it was our first class, the manner in which he explained everything helped make it easy to grasp the concepts. His teaching style was basic but effective, and it made a good impression on all of us. It wasn't like a normal lecture — it was more of a smooth beginning to our college academic life.

Following a brief recess, our next class was English, taught by Professor Nisha Ma'am. She also began with introductions but took it further by providing each student with feedback on how he or she could better himself. She was extremely keen and was able to pick up areas of improvement right away — be it confidence, fluency, or clarity of speech. Rather than highlighting mistakes in a derogatory manner, she directed us in a positive light and urged us all to improve our communication skills. Her session was highly beneficial and helped us to motivate ourselves to be better speakers. It was more like a personality development course than an ordinary English lecture.

We were then given the opportunity to attend two guest lectures in the auditorium, which followed the academic sessions. The first guest lecture was given by Mr. Arvind Jhingra, Director of STEP and also TAC Incharge. He presented very well and gave us useful information regarding different opportunities under STEP and how the students can gain from them during their college years. He also discussed how TAC aids in equipping the students with technical and professional skills.
The second lecture was given by Mr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna, who is the Incharge of Central Mechanical Lab (CML). His lecture was informative and centered on the need for hands-on learning in engineering. He outlined how the labs in our college are structured to give exposure to hands-on experience, which is needed to grasp real-world applications of theoretical concepts. He also stressed the need for discipline, curiosity, and persistence in performing lab work. Aside from this, he informed us about numerous technical facilities and resources at CML and encouraged us to utilize them to the best of our abilities. His love for teaching and care for student growth made the session inspiring. It inspired many of us to take our practical subjects more attentively and go beyond textbooks.

### Day 7

Seventh day of the induction was a very informative and interesting day. It provided us with valuable information about our future academic life and professional life.

The day started at the auditorium with a session of Digital Marketing Concepts (DMC) presented by Dr. Amit Kamra. He discussed the basic principles of digital marketing, such as the use of social media sites, data analytics, and online consumer behaviors. His examples were real and down-to-earth, and the session properly conveyed the idea of how digital marketing has become a necessity today in our technologically advanced world.

Then we witnessed a crucial session by Dr. Arvind Jhingra, Director of STEP and Incharge TAC. He gave us an overview of the activities and training schemes under STEP (Science & Technology Entrepreneurs Park). He discussed how students can gain from entrepreneurship workshops, internships, and other innovation-based projects. He also encouraged us to participate in activities that create skills at hands-on level outside classrooms.

Next to this, Dr. Randhir Singh dedicated a session to educate us about the examination process. He explained all the important aspects of the internal assessment process, external examinations, the criteria for attendance, and overall academic guidelines. His descriptions were extremely clear and provided us with a clearer vision about how to prepare ourselves throughout the semester.

Subsequently, yet another faculty member provided a presentation on the various courses and streams offered by the college, their ambit, and how students can correlate them with their career aspirations. He highlighted the significance of making sound choices and optimally utilizing resources available from the college. This session was very inspiring and helped us realize the broader vision of our educational journey.

To conclude the day, we had a lesson of Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BEEE) by Prof. Mandeep Kaur. She gave us an introduction to electricity and electronics basics, the basic concepts behind them, and how the course relates to actual engineering applications in real life. Her method of teaching was great, and we enjoyed the lesson and found it easy to understand.
