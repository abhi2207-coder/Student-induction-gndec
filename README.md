### Day 1

We started our college life with a trip to the Gurudwara. The environment there was calm and optimistic. We heard some very profound and motivational ideas, which set the day on the right note. Then we were given breakfast, which was delicious and neatly placed.
I'm telling you, when I saw the Gurdwara, I really liked it. The atmosphere there was peaceful and calm. The structure looked beautiful, and the overall vibe gave a very positive feeling. It was a nice start to the day.

After this, we shifted to the college auditorium, where the rest of the program took place. We were welcomed by the Principal of the college in his warm speech. He gave some precious insights regarding discipline, concentration, and utilizing college life to the fullest. He advised us to remain curious, be an active participant, and never think twice before asking any questions. His speech was really inspiring and encouraged us further to join the college.After the speeches in the auditorium, we went to see our respective departments. The classrooms, labs, and overall environment looked really nice. Everything felt new and exciting, and I genuinely liked the department a lot.The first day of college turned out to be a really memorable experience. From visiting the Gurdwara in the morning to attending the speeches in the auditorium and exploring our departments, everything felt exciting and fresh. The environment, the people, and the energy around made me feel happy and a bit more confident about this new journey. Honestly, I didn’t expect the day to go so well, but it really left a good impression on me.

### Day 2

On the second day of the induction programme, we had our proficiency tests for both Maths and English. These tests were taken to check our basic understanding of the subjects and to help the faculty know our current level. The atmosphere was a bit serious that day, as everyone was slightly nervous about how the tests would go.

The Maths test had a mix of basic concepts and logical questions. Some parts were easy, but a few questions made us think a bit harder. The English test was more about grammar, comprehension, and vocabulary. It was not too tough, but we had to stay focused.

Honestly, the best part was that the tests didn’t feel like pressure. They were more like a way to reflect on what we already know and where we can improve. Overall, Day 2 was more academic compared to the first day, but it still felt like an important part of settling into college life.

### Day 3

The third day of the induction programme was all about gaining knowledge and new perspectives. We had two lectures scheduled, both of which were held in the college auditorium. The first session was by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, who gave a very informative talk on IAPT (Indian Association of Physics Teachers). He explained what IAPT is, how it supports the growth of physics education in India, and how students can get involved through various exams and activities. He also shared his own experiences and motivated us to think beyond textbooks and explore the subject more deeply. It was a really eye-opening session for many of us.

After that, we had the second lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Madam, who spoke on the topic of Universal Human Values. Her session was more emotional and thought-provoking. She talked about the importance of kindness, respect, empathy, and living a meaningful life. The way she explained the connection between values and real-life situations made it very relatable. She encouraged us to look within ourselves and think about how we treat others, not just focus on academic success.

Both the lectures were quite different in nature — one was more academic, and the other focused on life and character — but together, they made the day truly impactful. It felt like we didn’t just attend lectures, but actually learned something valuable for life.
