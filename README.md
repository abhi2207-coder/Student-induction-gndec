### Day 1

We started our college life with a trip to the Gurudwara. The environment there was calm and optimistic. We heard some very profound and motivational ideas, which set the day on the right note. Then we were given breakfast, which was delicious and neatly placed.
I'm telling you, when I saw the Gurdwara, I really liked it. The atmosphere there was peaceful and calm. The structure looked beautiful, and the overall vibe gave a very positive feeling. It was a nice start to the day.

After this, we shifted to the college auditorium, where the rest of the program took place. We were welcomed by the Principal of the college in his warm speech. He gave some precious insights regarding discipline, concentration, and utilizing college life to the fullest. He advised us to remain curious, be an active participant, and never think twice before asking any questions. His speech was really inspiring and encouraged us further to join the college.After the speeches in the auditorium, we went to see our respective departments. The classrooms, labs, and overall environment looked really nice. Everything felt new and exciting, and I genuinely liked the department a lot.The first day of college turned out to be a really memorable experience. From visiting the Gurdwara in the morning to attending the speeches in the auditorium and exploring our departments, everything felt exciting and fresh. The environment, the people, and the energy around made me feel happy and a bit more confident about this new journey. Honestly, I didn’t expect the day to go so well, but it really left a good impression on me.

### Day 2

On the second day of the induction programme, we had our proficiency tests for both Maths and English. These tests were taken to check our basic understanding of the subjects and to help the faculty know our current level. The atmosphere was a bit serious that day, as everyone was slightly nervous about how the tests would go.

The Maths test had a mix of basic concepts and logical questions. Some parts were easy, but a few questions made us think a bit harder. The English test was more about grammar, comprehension, and vocabulary. It was not too tough, but we had to stay focused.

Honestly, the best part was that the tests didn’t feel like pressure. They were more like a way to reflect on what we already know and where we can improve. Overall, Day 2 was more academic compared to the first day, but it still felt like an important part of settling into college life.

### Day 3

The third day of the induction programme was all about gaining knowledge and new perspectives. We had two lectures scheduled, both of which were held in the college auditorium. The first session was by Dr. Jaswinder Singh, who gave a very informative talk on IAPT (Indian Association of Physics Teachers). He explained what IAPT is, how it supports the growth of physics education in India, and how students can get involved through various exams and activities. He also shared his own experiences and motivated us to think beyond textbooks and explore the subject more deeply. It was a really eye-opening session for many of us.

After that, we had the second lecture by Dr. Priya Darshni Madam, who spoke on the topic of Universal Human Values. Her session was more emotional and thought-provoking. She talked about the importance of kindness, respect, empathy, and living a meaningful life. The way she explained the connection between values and real-life situations made it very relatable. She encouraged us to look within ourselves and think about how we treat others, not just focus on academic success.

Both the lectures were quite different in nature — one was more academic, and the other focused on life and character — but together, they made the day truly impactful. It felt like we didn’t just attend lectures, but actually learned something valuable for life.
### Day 4

The fourth day of the induction programme felt different, as it was the first time we attended our actual college classes. Until now, most of the sessions were introductory or seminar-based, but Day 4 gave us the real feeling of being engineering students. The first class of the day was P2P (Peer to Peer Learning), which was conducted by our seniors. They started by teaching us the basics of C++ programming. We were shown how to write a simple "Hello World" program, and they explained each line in a very easy-to-understand way. Most of us were completely new to coding, but the friendly nature of the seniors made us feel comfortable. They encouraged us to ask doubts and learn at our own pace. It felt great to learn something practical right from the beginning.

After that, we had our second class — BEEE (Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering) — where we were introduced to the subject by Professor Harminder Kaur. She welcomed us warmly and interacted with everyone to make the session more engaging. Instead of jumping directly into the syllabus, she took the time to know us, asked about our interests, and explained how this subject will be helpful in the coming semesters. Her way of explaining things was clear and encouraging, which made a good first impression on all of us.

After these two sessions, we had a short break, which gave us time to relax and interact with our new classmates. It was a much-needed pause in the middle of a full day.

Post-break, we had a lecture on Universal Human Values (UHV). The session focused on understanding life beyond academics — values like respect, kindness, empathy, and self-awareness were discussed. The way the concepts were explained made us think deeply about our behavior and mindset. It was a peaceful and meaningful session.

The final session of the day was conducted by the Causmic Club. The members of the club introduced themselves and gave us a detailed overview of what the club does. They shared their experiences, activities, and the opportunities we could get by being part of it. It was exciting to see how college is not just about studies, but also about clubs, events, and exploring our interests.

Overall, Day 4 was long, but full of learning, interactions, and new experiences. It felt like we were 

truly becoming a part of the college.


### Day 5
On the fifth day, our section was called to complete the ID card registration. The process was quick and simple. Just like that, our day came to an end.


### Day 6

The sixth day of our induction program started with a Chemistry class conducted by Mr. Karan Bhalla. As soon as he entered the room, he greeted all of us with a warm smile, which created a positive and welcoming atmosphere. He began the session by asking each student to introduce themselves, which helped in building a connection with the class. His way of talking was very polite and respectful, and he made sure everyone felt comfortable during the interaction. After the introductions, he moved on to teaching a few important Chemistry formulas. Even though it was our first class, the way he explained everything made the concepts easy to understand. His teaching style was simple yet effective, and it left a good impression on all of us. It didn’t feel like a typical lecture — it was more like a smooth start to our academic journey in college.

After a short break, our next session was English, taken by Professor Nisha Ma’am. She also started with introductions but went one step further by giving each student feedback on how they could improve themselves. She was very observant and quickly noticed areas where we could do better — whether it was confidence, fluency, or clarity while speaking. Instead of pointing out flaws in a negative way, she guided us positively and encouraged everyone to work on their communication skills. Her session was extremely helpful and gave us the motivation to become better speakers. It felt more like a personality development class than just an English lecture.

After the academic sessions, we attended two guest lectures in the auditorium. The first lecture was delivered by Mr. Arvind Jhingra, who is the Director of STEP and also Incharge of TAC. He spoke in a very engaging way and shared valuable insights about various opportunities available through STEP and how students can benefit from them during their time at college. He also explained how TAC supports students in developing their technical and professional skills.The second lecture was delivered by Mr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna, who is the Incharge of the Central Mechanical Lab (CML). His session was highly informative and focused on the importance of practical learning in engineering. He explained how the labs in our college are designed to provide hands-on experience, which is essential for understanding real-world applications of theoretical knowledge. He also emphasized the value of discipline, curiosity, and consistency in approaching lab work. Apart from this, he gave us an overview of various technical resources and facilities available in CML and encouraged us to make the most of them. His passion for teaching and focus on student development made the session truly inspiring. It motivated many of us to take our practical subjects more seriously and explore beyond just textbooks.


### Day 7

The seventh day of the induction program was informative and engaging. It gave us important insights into our upcoming academic life and professional world.

The day began in the auditorium with a session on Digital Marketing Concepts (DMC) by Dr. Amit Kamra. He explained the fundamentals of digital marketing, including the use of social media platforms, data analytics, and online consumer behavior. His examples were relatable, and the session gave us a clear idea of how digital marketing has become essential in today's technology-driven world.

After that, we attended an important session conducted by Dr. Arvind Jhingra, the Director of STEP and Incharge of TAC. He introduced us to the initiatives and training programs under STEP (Science & Technology Entrepreneurs Park). He explained how students can benefit from entrepreneurship workshops, internships, and various innovation-based projects. He also motivated us to take part in activities that build practical skills beyond classroom learning.

Following this, Dr. Randhir Singh took a session to inform us about the examination system. He covered all the essential points regarding the internal assessment process, external exams, attendance criteria, and overall academic regulations. His explanations were very clear and gave us a better understanding of how to stay prepared throughout the semester.

Later, another faculty member gave a talk about the different courses and branches available in the college, their scope, and how students can align them with their career goals. He emphasized the importance of making informed decisions and making the best use of resources provided by the college. This session was quite motivating and helped us understand the larger vision of our educational journey.

To end the day, we had a class of Basic Electrical and Electronics Engineering (BEEE) conducted by Prof. Mandeep Kaur. She introduced us to the basics of electricity and electronics, the core concepts involved, and how the subject connects with real-life applications in engineering. Her teaching style was very effective, and we found the class interesting and easy to grasp.
